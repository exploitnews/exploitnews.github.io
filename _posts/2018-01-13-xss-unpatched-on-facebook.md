Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected 

into otherwise benign and trusted web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web 

application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different 

end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web 

application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding 

it.

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end userâ€™s browser 

has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it 

thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session 

tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These 

scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.


In my searches for bugs on facebook I found this hack, where any user accessing facebook.com by a 

browser can execute some malicious code on it.


## [](#header-2) Lets Try!


First open the site facebook.com in your browser, I will not specify any browser, but I am using 

Chrome, latest version.

Soon after, with the auxiliary button of your mouse or pressing the f12 key on your keyboard, open 

the devtools of your browser and look for "console" ```js type alert (document.domain);``` and 

press enter.

Finally, we have our alert, so a hacker could take advantage of this vulnerability and use 

malicious scripts to steal a user's session.
