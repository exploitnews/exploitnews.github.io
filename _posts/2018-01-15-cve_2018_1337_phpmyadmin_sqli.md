Recently, security researchers have encountered a vulnerability based on sql injection known as Sql Injection, which allows someone to scan and list all the databases on the server or site that is using PhpMyadmin.
With thousands of users, the vulnerability affects 100% of PhpMyadmin users.

## [](#header-) What is PhpMyadmin? 
PhpMyAdmin is a free software tool written in PHP, intended to handle the administration of MySQL over the Web. phpMyAdmin supports a wide range of operations on MySQL and MariaDB. Frequently used operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.


A SQL injection attack consists of insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. SQL injection attacks are a type of injection attack, in which SQL commands are injected into data-plane input in order to effect the execution of predefined SQL commands.


## [](#header-2) PoC:


In this seemingly harmless area, phpmyadmin allows the user to type texts and execute some codes, so the researchers decided to send some commands in the text area and, as expected, worked.

For the reproduction of the examples we use the demo page of PhpMyAdmin on its official website ```https://demo.phpmyadmin.net/master-config/```

The vulnerability has not yet been fixed, it is not yet known when the phpmyadmin team will return with chants.
